The course has both a theoretical and applied focus. First, we examine how qualitative research is used in educational research. We will discuss qualitative methods as an interpretive inquiry focusing on topics such as the development and use of theory, kinds and interpretation of data, and issues of reliability. We will compare the different methods and methodologies used by researchers. Students will analyze and critique research articles using ideas and concepts discussed in the required texts and in class. Second, students will engage in a pilot study of their own in which they apply and experience qualitative research for themselves. Here students will develop a question, examine their own theoretical position, conduct a review of the literature, collect data, and produce a research paper.
