/**
 * Ground rules for random stuff:
 * - NEVER REBASE (ask for permission, likely I'll say no)
 * - Maximum 3 layers of abstraction!!! (VERY IMPT) If you have a reason to go deeper pls contact me (@Arika)
 * - KISS Principles (Keep it simple, stupid)
 * - Only use GPT if you're not going to create a lot of trash very quickly.
 * - Document by naming your methods/variables well
 * - Use javadoc comments to explain non-trivial methods, or just how they work
 *
 * Code layout (packages):
 * AlgoSorter: usr inp, and final output data. Will have atleast 2 classes: one to output all classes usr inp, & another 2 deal with given data.
 * fileBuilder: WebScrapper, data normalizer. Obtain data from classNav and throw it into a CSV file
 * Classes: Std class templates for i/o reading (java class of a school class for ease of data reading
 *
 * Eventually should return JSON format of all possible classes, from there can prettify somehow...
