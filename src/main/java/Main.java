/**
 * Ground rules for random stuff:
 * - NEVER REBASE (ask for permission, likely I'll say no)
 * - Maximum 3 layers of abstraction!!! (VERY IMPT) If you have a reason to go deeper pls contact me (@Arika)
 * - KISS Principles (Keep it simple, stupid)
 * - Only use GPT if you're not going to create a lot of trash very quickly.
 * - Document by naming your methods/variables well
 * - Use javadoc comments to explain non-trivial methods, or just how they work
