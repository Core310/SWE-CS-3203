# About
BetterClassNav is a web service that eases a studentâ€™s process of signing up for multiple
classes. Unlike the current classNav, searching only requires students to input all class IDs or
names. The output produces a list of class sections, where no timings collide. This contrasts
with the current classNav forcing students to find all the class timings manually and create a
schedule from there leading to a much smoother signup process for students and thus resulting
in slightly reduced workloads for academic advisors.

# How it works:
Each `class` object is stored as below, where each avaliable Course is pulled up. After calling all COURSES, the program will return all possible permutations of all courses, and you can pick which one fits your schedule best.  
`MeetingDates,MeetingTimes,MeetingDays,Location,Crn,Subject,Course,Section,SectionTitle,Instructor,Seats,Waitlist`
OR 
```json
  {
    "MeetingDates": "value1",
    "MeetingTimes": "value2",
    "MeetingDays": "value3",
    "Location": "value4",
    "Crn": "value5",
    "Subject": "value6",
    "Course": "value7",
    "Section": "value8",
    "SectionTitle": "value9",
    "Instructor": "value10",
    "Seats": "value11",
    "Waitlist": "value12"
  },

```
