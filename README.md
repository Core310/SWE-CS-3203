# About
BetterClassNav is a web service that eases a studentâ€™s process of signing up for multiple
classes. Unlike the current classNav, searching only requires students to input all class IDs or
names. The output produces a list of class sections, where no timings collide. This contrasts
with the current classNav forcing students to find all the class timings manually and create a
schedule from there leading to a much smoother signup process for students and thus resulting
in slightly reduced workloads for academic advisors.
