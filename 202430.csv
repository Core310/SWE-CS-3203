Seasson Vitiello
CLASS DESCRIPTION
Important Notice: All sections of BIOL/PBIO/MBIO 3113, Cell Biology, have been selected for an “Inclusive Access” program which provides less expensive digital course materials, easier purchase, and direct delivery through Canvas. All Inclusive Access digital course materials are provided to enrolled students by the first day of class through Canvas. The Inclusive Access materials are listed at Soonerbooks.com, but no further action is needed to purchase them. The enrolled student’s OU Bursar account will be billed directly for these digital materials at a significant discount. Instead of the standard bookstore rate of $93.75 for Essential Cell Bio, Ebook + SW5 + Animations (5thed.), by Alberts, Hopkin & Johnson, only $59.50 will be billed. The Inclusive Access program only applies to the referenced material and does not include any other required materials, such as course-packs, calculators, lab equipment, etc. You may have the option to purchase a discounted loose-leaf version of the textbook to accompany your eText. If available, this optional printed text can be purchased directly through the Soonerbooks.com portal. Students may opt-out of this program through their Soonerbooks account eLibrary; however, the digital course materials are required, are necessary for maximum success in this course, and are not available anywhere for a lower price.

(Crosslisted with BOT and BIOL 3113) Prerequisite: Botany 1114, or Biology 1134, or Biology 1114 and 1121, or Biology 1124; and Chemistry 3053. Introduction to the cell as a unit of life. A chemical and physical comparison of procaryotic and eucaryotic cells to include a discussion of cell metabolism, types of metabolic regulation and an analysis of ultrastructure. Emphasis will be placed on the dynamic changes in metabolism and ultrastructure which occur during the life of a cell. (F, Sp)
